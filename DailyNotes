Plan:
- fix saveUptakeRxns function to search for exchange reactions
- Find OXPHOS signature reactions and Glycolysis signature reactions
- Read through papers for flux sampling results and graphs
- once found exchange reactions, ACHR sample Naive, Mutant, and Memory Effector flux spaces and histogram flux samples
