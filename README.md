# TcellCOBRA
MATLAB codes for reconstruction of T cell metabolic models based on the multi-omics data

# Required libraries and models 
## Initializing COBRA Toolbox

```MATLAB
initCobraToolbox(false) %don't update the toolbox
changeCobraSolver ('glpk', 'all');
```

## Reading Recon3D curated model
```MATLAB
% Reading curated recon 3 model
modelFileName = 'Recon3DModel_301.mat';
modelDirectory = getDistributedModelFolder(modelFileName); %Look up the folder for the distributed Models.
modelFileName= [modelDirectory filesep modelFileName]; % Get the full path. Necessary to be sure, that the right model is loaded
model = readCbModel(modelFileName);
```
